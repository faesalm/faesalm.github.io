        Hi! I'm <strong>Faesal</strong>, a Software Engineer at <a href="https://about.google/"><span

      <p>
        During my first year at Google, I worked as a Software Engineer for the Google Cloud's SRE team, developing
        planet-scale Infrastructure that supports the industry-leading reliability Google is known for. I currently work
        as a Software Engieer improving internal dashboard creation processes.

        <h3>Loan Default Risk Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Loan defaults are not only bad for business but are also stressful for the loan taker. Defaulting on a loan
          not only means the bank lost money, but the client’s credit score has dropped significantly, and it is
          unlikely a bank will be willing to lend money to the person in the future. If it is possible to predict and
          maximize the repayment rate of loans, this would be a great benefit to both parties in the exchange.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The data for the this project was extracted from Kaggle's <a
            href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/overview"><span class="label">Home Credit Default
              Risk Competition</span></a>. My team applied a variety of advanced algorithms to engineer a machine
          learning model for predicting loan default risk. Some of the advanced methods used are: Feature Engineering,
          LightGBM, and using GridSearch for optimization.

        <p>
          We were able to achieve 75% prediction accuracy in the Kaggle competition, while the first place winner scored
          80%

        <h3>Google SPS</h3>
        <p>
          Google’s <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/softwareproductsprint/"><span
              class="label">Software Product Sprint (SPS)</span></a> is an 11-week invite-only program for
          high-potential students. During SPS, my team developed a web application for finding compatible roommates
          using Java, JavaScript, and leveraging Cloud Datastore to store user profiles. We collaborated with Software
          Engineers at Google to use best practices and overcome challenges.

          During my Google internship, I served as a panelist for the next iteration of the program to share my journey.

        <h3>BattleSnake</h3>
        <p>
          BattleSnake is a national hackathon where developers across Canada
          form teams to build AI snakes. At every game, a number of snakes
          compete on the same board, with the winner being the last one
          standing.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          My team's AI was able of defeating multiple competing snakes, as well as a variety of bounty snakes, which are
          snakes created by industry sponsors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The snake has a variety of game strategies, playing defensively and chasing its tail when the board is
          crowded, and taking risks when it only a few snakes remain. It also uses graph coloring algorithms to predict
          if it will get stuck.

        <h3>Engineering Robotics Competition</h3>
        <p>
          The Engineering Robotics Competiton is an annual, semester-long competition held for engineering students
          where the task is given at the start of the semester. For 2019, the task was to create an autonomous robot to
          tether cables to IR beacons, serving as a prototype for an underwater rover for internet cable tethering.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our robot was the fastest to complete all of the competition tasks. The robot had various optimizations, such
          as dynamic speed settings based on the distance from the target, as well as adjusting motors unevenly to steer
          the robot. The robot was programmed using RobotC (a variant of C).
